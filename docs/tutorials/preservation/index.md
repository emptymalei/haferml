# Preservation

HaferML provides functions and utilities to sync data and model artifacts with cloud storage, e.g. S3.

!!! warning
    We only support S3 at this moment. However, this can be easily extended to other platforms.

## Upload to S3


See [`haferml.sync.aws.aws_cli`][haferml.sync.aws.aws_cli] for examples.
